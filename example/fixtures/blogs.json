That's not the objective at all. When I interview someone, I am sincerely looking for a person who may not have much experience, but is: mature, hard working and in whom I can see tremendous potential. I want applicants to do well in their interview and to succeed broadly in their career beyond Virtue Center.<\/p>\n<h2>Asking a Painter About Brushes<\/h2>\n<p>As an interviewer, the worst thing I can ever do is to telegraph the answer I am looking for to a particular question. For example, I would not ask a person if they are organized and detail oriented, because everyone will simply say that they were. I pose questions that hopefully the person can not necessarily know my preferred response. Over the years I have standardized my interview questions to consist of a series of questions that start off easy, and then get progressively harder with each successive question. Once an applicant gets a question wrong, I switch to a different topic.<\/p>\n<p>The first question I ask of programmers is: <em>what is the difference between a class and an object<\/em>. Now, I get that to a non-technical person this may seem like some kind of cryptic trick question. It's not - at all. It's like asking a painter the difference between paint and brushes or a mechanic the difference between gas and tires. No one who has completed their studies in programming should ever have any difficulty with this question. Yet, time and time again I hear applicants say \"oh, I know this one\u2026 umm\u2026\" or \"give me a moment\u2026\" - trying to buy themselves some time while they think back on which day in class that this topic was covered or try to craft a convincing guess. I wish at that point that we could just go over to the white board and I could spend the minute it would take to explain this elementary topic. But this is an interview after all, not the introduction to the introduction to programming. So I listen. If they get it right - awesome - they are off to a good start to what will probably be a smooth interview. But if they have trouble, I can't even ask any further questions. What would be the point? Out of politeness I will ask some customary interview questions about aspirations and how they got into programming. We will shake hands, exchange pleasantries and probably never see each other ever again. To be clear, plenty of people get this (and many more) questions correct, but the number of applicants who do not is shocking.<\/p>\n<h2>Are You Hoping for a Miracle?<\/h2>\n<p>I have been told in the past by one college that I have hired and interviewed more programmers from their school than all of the other companies combined in a particular year. That's because I sincerely want to hire people from the local community and people who have chosen specifically to study programming. It's a win-win, because as a start-up, I'm not offering the greatest compensation, but I can offer a remarkable opportunity to gain industry experience. Why then, does this awkward interview happen again and again? I have a few theories, the prevailing one is that many schools simply are not preparing students for the real world of programming. They are degree factories, cashing-in on young people that can't afford a better education or simply don't know the difference between a good or bad technology eductation. Many people I interview may be the first in their family to have obtained a degree, and perhaps there was no one who could guide them though the maze of becoming successful in technology.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of the matter is that Programming is a <em>craft<\/em>. It's has no resemblance to accounting or business administration. Furthermore, most of the books on the subject of programming are not worth the lost time it would take to actually read them. Programming is about learning a few fundamental concepts an applying them. And applying them, and re-applying them for hundreds of hours. The same way a sculptor chips away at a their first stone or an author writes and re-writes their first story, a programmer must program and re-program.<\/p>\n<p>As a craft, programming is best learned either slowly though personal experimentation (the road I took) or more quickly as an art passed on from one artisan to another in a chain of apprenticeship. The problem is that many of the professors of computer programming are not artisans and as such, have never written a substantial program nor do have they themselves grasp the nature of programming experientially . They have never locked themselves away in a room, toiling all night, trying to solve a technical problem, fueled only by adrenaline and caffeine. They are like pilots that have never been in the air\u2026 or a lifeguard who can't swim.<\/p>\n<p>To determine if you are about to be robbed of your time and money by a inadequate educator, you must conduct an interview. Respectfully, ask your instructor about the most challenging program they have ever written or the most rewarding concept they had to master. You should see a gleam in their eyes and they should extol an epic tale of trial and error and personal breakthroughs. If not - run. Run to the admissions office and see if you can get your money back. Write a letter to the dean. Something has gone horribly wrong. Because if you \"learn\" from this well intending but incapable person, you may find yourself years later squirming in a chair across from me unable to answer one simple question and unable to repay your student loans.<\/p>\n<h2>Come to Success<\/h2>\n<p>The most successful programmers that I have ever worked with are the ones who took matters into their own hands. Degree or no degree. They asked essential questions: What language should I learn? How do I set up my computer to write software? How do I set up a web server? What is Object Oriented Programming? How can I write more efficient code? What is good coding style? They sought out answers to these questions wherever they could find them: from mentors, from classmates, from Google searches, message boards and in chat rooms. They were never satisfied until they applied the concepts and could see for themselves how a concept works. The hours they put into their personal projects dwarfed their class time. They built their confidence by achieving a series of small successes and eventually found that they could write any software they could imagine and probably work at any company they chose.<\/p>\n<h2>Epilogue<\/h2>\n<p>If this depiction sounds in any way similar to your education experience, then I am very sorry to hear that! On the other hand, if you are someone who has taken matters into your own hands and become adept at programming than I commend you and hope we can collaborate at some point. If you haven't logged the hours necessary to be an excellent programmer, or are not sure where to start, there is still time! Feel free to contact us at Virtue Center for resources and suggestions on how to learn this rewarding craft.<\/p>\n<\/div><button contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"cke-particle-type btn image\" data-id=\"4fdbada4aa8eecee1f000010\"><\/button>","categories":["4f492d6eaa8eecb738000002"],"code_name":"the_scariest_interview_1330195571","comments":"t","description":"Some reflections on the high percentage of unqualified technology applicants.

Code re-use is a major architectural goal software projects because it makes development faster and cheaper. That being said, traits don't make it possible to do anything that could not have already been done before with <span class=\"caps\">PHP<\/span>, however, traits offers a better and perhaps more natural or <em>expressive<\/em> way to achieve certain kinds of re-use.<\/p>\n<h2>Expressiveness<\/h2>\n<p>People seem to put software development into the category of mathematics, as if writing a program was like writing an equation - it's usually not. Personally, I see programming as being a form of similar of creative writing. The essential experience of programming is thinking and writing. The main tool of a programmer is the integrated development environment [IDE] which is really just like Notepad on steroids. So, we sit at our desks (or on a train) and express our ideas through writing. When something comes along that makes the language we use to communicate our ideas more expressive, this is a big deal!<\/p>\n<p>Expressiveness is probably why I am not a fan Java, and I like Javascript - once you are comfortable with Javascript, it offers many concise language constructs with which to express yourself, whereas Java's pedantic nature makes even the smallest idea tedious to type.<\/p>\n<p>My intention in writing this post was not to talk about <span class=\"caps\">PHP<\/span>, not Javascript, but I think to see the significance of this development, it's helpful to look back at <span class=\"caps\">PHP<\/span> 5.3's most major language enhancement - closures \/ lambda functions \/ anonymous functions and to note that it was most likely the mainstreaming of the closure feature in Javascript that put a sort-of peer pressure onto <span class=\"caps\">PHP<\/span> to have the same feature. I certainly remember using closures in Javascript for a while and wishing I could do the same in <span class=\"caps\">PHP<\/span>. I'm not sure if another language has popularized traits (I know Scala and Objective-C have traits as well), but wherever the inspiration came from, traits are certainly a welcome addition.<\/p>\n<h2>The Specific Advantage<\/h2>\n<p>Class inheritance has been the main way of achieving code re-use in <span class=\"caps\">PHP<\/span> up until now. At Virtue Center, we recently came across a scenario where we had two Classes (model classes) that we wanted anothter class to re-use. Prior to the addition of traits, we would have had to set up a linear inheritance chain. Something like: FrameworkModel -&gt; EventsModel -&gt; BlogModel -&gt; CustomerModel. This is frustrating, because it makes it seem as if BlogModel has something to do with EventsModel (it doesn't) but there is no other way for CustomerModel to inherit the methods of both classes other than to line them into a chain of inheritance. Enter traits. Now, we can make EventsModel as trait, BlogModel as trait and then CustomerModel would extend FrameworkModel and make use of both the EventsModel and BlogModel. The two traits are no longer in any relationship other than sometimes they are both being employed by the same class.<\/p>\n<h2>The Subtle Advantage<\/h2>\n<p>Classes serve essentially two purposes: first, as a template from which to instantiate objects, and second, as a grouping of methods. Traits are simply a grouping of methods, they can not be instantiated. Having to define certain groupings of methods as a class (even if you make it abstract) is a bit misleading in a way, because is implies that maybe you might want to instantiate these groupings, although when they were not written with this intentions in mind. Now, we can use traits for this purpose as we would no longer need to make such groupings as a class.<\/p>\n<h2>Relevant Links<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A good example: <a href=\"http:\/\/simas.posterous.com\/new-to-php-54-traits\" title=\"Example\">http:\/\/simas.posterous.com\/new-to-php-54-traits<\/a><\/li>\n<li>From wikipedia: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trait_(computer_programming\" title=\"Wikipedia\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trait_(computer_programming)<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>The <span class=\"caps\">PHP<\/span> RFC: <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.php.net\/rfc\/horizontalreuse\" title=\"Horizontal Reuse\">https:\/\/wiki.php.net\/rfc\/horizontalreuse<\/a><\/li>\n<li>From an academic standpoint: <a href=\"http:\/\/scg.unibe.ch\/archive\/papers\/Scha03aTraits.pdf\" title=\"Composable Units of Behavior\">http:\/\/scg.unibe.ch\/archive\/papers\/Scha03aTraits.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","categories":["4f492d65aa8eecec3e00001c"],"code_name":"php_54_traits_1330195571","comments":"t","description":"A look into the importance of traits as a new language construct in PHP.

From the user's perspective, it's pretty annoying to have to create a new account on every different website you want to access. Being able to click a button and approve credential sharing is much easier than creating a brand new account and dreaming up a new password - or worse, recycling the same on again. It can cause some confusion for users who can not remember which login option that they originally chose, also, if they close their social media account, they will also lose access to your site. These disadvantages are fairly small compared to the potentially huge boost in registrations and logins.<\/p>\n<h2>Rolling Your Own<\/h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, each of the mainstream social login (or federated login) providers does offer an open <span class=\"caps\">API<\/span> that you can use to integrate social login with your site. Although they provide an end-point, you still have to do a significant amount of coding to get it working on your site! If you are only integrating one social login option, it's probably not too difficult to do it. It might even be fun to utilize a social login <span class=\"caps\">API<\/span> and make cURL-<span class=\"caps\">JSON<\/span> requests (or whatever is required), but if you plan to integrate several, I would not recommend undertaking such a project unless you are doing it as a learning experience or creating a business out of it, because it will certainly take a lot of effort. The next option, using something existing that is already open source is probably more reasonable.<\/p>\n<h2>Open Source Library<\/h2>\n<p>It's a bit difficult to find open source social login offerings because when you search for them on Google the results are all of the place. To find a reasonably popular solution, I went straight to GitHub and did a search for \"social login\". After a bit of clicking around, I came to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/hybridauth\/hybridauth\" title=\"HybridAuth\">HybridAuth<\/a> that seems to have a lot of providers supported and is written in <span class=\"caps\">PHP<\/span> (of course!). The main benefit of using this is that there is already an existing user base and development community around this project. So, if you need help integrating it, you could probably find a wealth of examples and even get help from the community. If you build upon it by adding a new provider, you will probably make a lot of people happy and maybe make some new friends in the process.<\/p>\n<h2>Commercial Offerings<\/h2>\n<p>The obvious disadvantage of a commercial offering is that it is not free, duh. If you take a broader view however, it may be less expensive in the long-run if it takes less developer hours to integrate. If you don't expect to have a large user base, you may even get away using a free-tier of the commercial offering. But if you do end up having a significant number of users, that this option can get expensive as there is a monthly service fee that increases based on the number of users. Some of the benefits are robust reporting and possibly high quality customer support. If your project has a nice budget, these options may fit right in. Here are a list of the top offerings I could find:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.janrain.com\" title=\"JanRain\">JanRain<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gigya.com\/\" title=\"Gigya\">Gigya<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.oneall.com\/\" title=\"Oneall\">OneAll<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Social login is important and one more consideration if you have or build websites. The scope of what is needed to build a competitive website is ever-increasing and staying on top of trends can be tiring - or exciting depending on how you look at it. As far as I can tell, social login is not a fad and if you are not already using it, you probably should be. If you need help integrating it on your website, feel free to give us a buzz.<\/p>\n<\/div><button contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"cke-particle-type btn image\" data-id=\"4fdbada4aa8eecee1f000012\"><\/button>","categories":["4ef4f739aa8eec233a000008"],"code_name":"social_login_1330195571","comments":"t","description":"Social Login can dramatically increase the number of registrations and logins on a website.

This has been substantiated from research going back to the 80's when the technologies being introduced were VCRs and interactive CD-ROMs.<\/p>\n<p>More recently we have schools spending millions on IPads only to have teachers ban them from being used in the classroom. I don't want to be taken as a Luddite or as having an overly nostalgic bias towards book learning\u2026 or the abacus\u2026 - I am sure that there are a variety ways to use technology appropriately in the classroom. What I think is interesting about what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WwslBPj8GgI\" title=\"Eric Mazur\">Eric Mazur<\/a> professor is advocating and also what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/\" title=\"Khan Academy\">Khan Academy<\/a> is also doing, is using technology outside the classroom to enhance the in-classroom experience.<\/p>\n<p>Technology may best be used by students who study independently outside the classroom who then use forums and chats to interact with other students and their teachers to discuss problematic topics. The key things here are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>the technology is used outside the classroom<\/li>\n<li>students review material on their own time<\/li>\n<li>material is reviewed by students <em>before<\/em> it is covered in class<\/li>\n<li>students may submit questions\/reflections anonymously<\/li>\n<li>students use website through their computer or phone to supply feedback<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In this model of blended learning, the professor is curating and then trouble-shooting the students learning rather that lecturing them into a coma. Students more or less go at their own pace, and utilize the teacher as a resource to surgically deal with certain topics, rather than monolithic source of all relevant material on the subject.<\/p>\n<h2>Blended Learning at Virtue Center<\/h2>\n<p>At Virtue Center, we embrace this model of teaching and learning when it comes to our students and interns. We will be launching a new product in the first quarter of 2012 that will help organizations embrace this model and at least one of our existing clients has already began to incorporate blended learning into their curriculum. See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oaktreeinstitute.org\/\" title=\"Oaktree Institute\">Oaktree Institute<\/a> (still in it's infancy, but off to a strong start).<\/p>\n<p>Please share your experiences with blended learning - both positive and negative - and any resources you have.

It was not long ago however, when clients were mostly concerned with their own websites. In this blog entry, I will suggest that social media and mobile technology make the traditional website <em>more<\/em> important than ever.<\/p>\n<h2>Social Media Sharecropping<\/h2>\n<p>First, let's look at social media. For most organizations, social media is about creating or promoting valuable content on social networks, often times primarily Facebook. Additionally, social media is a way to stay engaged in an online conversation with customers and constituents. This is old news, but it is worth mentioning that organizational use of Facebook is most effective when it is coordinated and consistent - in both tone and frequency. Still, no matter how active an organization may be on Facebook, it must be noted that ultimately, the organization is playing on someone else's ball field. That, like sharecropping, organizations must share the rewards of their hard labor with a wealthy land-owner, aka, Facebook, whose advertising revenues increase through the added benefit of organizations effective use of Facebook's \"land\": their social media platform.<\/p>\n<p>Since Facebook owns the field (conversation), Facebook sets the rules in terms of what an organization and their audience can and can not do. Think about it, it is Facebook that actually owns all of the media, data, meta-data and relationship-associations that an organization produces with their online social interactivity. Furthermore, Facebook itself is fueled by a constant \"stream\" of social interaction, so much so, that the life expectancy of any one unit of social content is increasingly short lived. For example, when someone puts a comment onto your posting on Facebook, that new content resides in Facebook permanently, but temporarily in-view on a user's aggregate news feed. To the extent that a given piece of content (share, like, comment) engages other users, Facebook achieves ever higher advertising impressions and clicks. Contrast this with the benefit that an organization would get if somehow they managed to incentivize users to post comments onto their own website. The organization itself would benefit from: increased search engine surface area, the ability to show their own advertisements, the ability to guide users to outcomes that Facebook does not directly support (joining a private mailing list, purchasing, donating, etc.).<\/p>\n<h2>Social Sharing as a Surrogate Activity<\/h2>\n<p>Another hidden danger of social network interaction for an organization's staff is that, because it does take quite a bit of time and effort, the person engaging with the network may feel that they have done something highly beneficial for their organization. It's possible that a lot of the content they posted on Facebook has such a short duration of visibility that the time takes to produce the social content could have been better spent elsewhere. In this sense, I argue that there are other efforts that can be done online that have a bigger impact that posting to Facebook (alone) or interacting with customers and constituents without having a way to draw them closer to an organization through the organization's own website.<\/p>\n<h2>Don Quixote of Cyberspace<\/h2>\n<p>I'm not arguing that Facebook should be ignored or that people should delete their accounts and company fan-pages. What I recommend, is that the core content that an organization produces should reside permanently and squarely within an organization's own website, in an appropriate and search-indexable location. Additionally, organizations should support comments, track-backs and other forms of interactivity from their own website. All that being said, it is essential that every time something new is posted to the the website, that it be packaged for and socially shared on social networks. In this way, Facebook is not replacing a website, but rather supporting the website as additional channel with which to temporarily push content to potentially interested users. Socially sharing website content may be the single best way to increase unique visits and positive measurable outcomes, but it is in a supportive role that if often brings the most benefit to an organization, not as an end-in-itself, but as a means of building a deeper and more significant working relationship with uses.<\/p>\n<h2>In Summary:<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook is a highly engaging environment for social interaction. The barrier to participation is low. However, organizations should think twice about neglecting their own website-presence in favor of a social network centric Internet strategy because, in the long run, they will be benefiting Facebook the most, at their organization's own expense. If an organization does not have the resources to build a website, then it's of great benefit that Facebook could provide a no-cost web presence. But if an organization does have the resources, then they would ideally have a robust website and a social media strategy to deliver users to their website and towards higher levels of interaction (donating, purchasing, sharing, etc) and simultaneously engage with the community on Facebook.<\/p>\n<h2>Mobile Applications<\/h2>\n<p>I had intended to discuss how mobile applications also make having a website necessary - but I will save that for a part II to this post.<\/p>\n<\/div><button contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"cke-particle-type btn image\" data-id=\"4fdbada4aa8eecee1f000016\"><\/button>","categories":["4f492d88aa8eec1220000004"],"code_name":"are_websites_still_relevant_1330195571","comments":"t","description":"More and more at Virtue Center, our work revolves around social media and mobile applications.

Anyhow, generally speaking, Dopamine is a substance occurring naturally in the brain that assists in the experience of human pleasure. Cocaine has such a dramatic effect on the brain because it causes a build-up of Dopamine which then leads to elevated levels of pleasure. But, you're smart, you probably already knew all that.<\/p>\n<p>Like cocaine use, we can develop a Dopamine release from various kinds of behaviors. Computer programming is one such behavior. Consider this: you might imagine that a person would not want to spend hours on end staring at a computer screen, skipping meals, losing track of time, only using a text editor, making small changes to a text file, observing small results, over and over again - in other words, the experience of computer programming. Those who enjoy, or, dare I say, are addicted to computer programming - they spend their time in a trance, going through the motions, waiting for the moment when they have solved a problem and their code does what it was intended to do, akin to the pleasure a person might get from solving puzzles for leisure. To make things worse (from an addiction stand point) it's hard to know when the puzzle will be properly solved, so a degree of nervous anticipation builds up before each verification and when the puzzle is finally solved, there is a mild or often intense feeling of pleasure. Which then shortly subsides as the programmer then repeats the cycle, onto the next puzzle, onto the next fix.<\/p>\n<p>Programmers may even display a degree of heightened irritability if a puzzle takes too long to solve, and a degree of reluctance to take on trivial tasks that are not suitably challenging; i.e., when the strain of the work involved outweighs the pleasure payout. This might just be a measure to separate the addicts from the team players: their willingness to do the \"boring stuff\" that gets the project done vs. their zeal for the \"hard stuff\" that makes it interesting. Obviously, few people like to do the \"boring stuff\" involved in any endeavor, but to the programming addict, it's almost unbearable.<\/p>\n<h2>Great Programmers: Sometimes Addicts<\/h2>\n<p>To get good at programming, or arguably any non-trivial challenging skill, you have to spend a lot of time doing it. Hundreds of hours, perhaps even thousands. There is an innate pleasure associated with learning. Some people experience it more than others. Programming is unique in a sense, in terms of how many opportunities it can present to solve a puzzle and how unpredictable puzzle resolution can be. I am not a neurologist, nor have I conducted any formal studies, but anecdotally and empirically, I've noticed that many great programmers may have become great because they experienced a pleasure incentive that got them so addicted to the activity, that they spent so much time doing it, that they just inevitably became quite good at it. Part of how they got so great is that they continually needed ever more complex and challenging puzzles to solve so they could go through the incentive cycle again and again as a person does not get the same (or any) pleasure experience from learning something they already know or solving a puzzle they have already solved.<\/p>\n<h2>The Dark Side: Going Off Script<\/h2>\n<p>As anyone who is an addict or has lived with one knows, an addict's main priority is getting their fix - not: taking the kids out to play and certainly not getting a programming project completed. I once worked with a brilliant programmer who I believe was so addicted, that he would create challenges where there were none to make his work more interesting - I think this made the work bearable for him. Usually, he could not complete a project, because once all the interesting stuff was done, he simply could not motivate himself to keep on working on it. Clearly this was extreme and unhealthy.<\/p>\n<p>From a business perspective, addicted programmers are in themselves a kind of temptation to employers. They can do amazing things that others can not do and often in a much in shorter time span. They have no problem working for long hours and are intrinsically motivated to work. However, they can also be very dangerous, specifically because they frequently go off-script. They have their own agenda where they create challenges where there otherwise may not have needed to exist or they work on some minor tangential aspect of a project for hours on end, leaving the project plan behind to program what they feel that they need to, not what the project itself needs.<\/p>\n<h2>Remedies<\/h2>\n<p>If you are or a programmer you know is someone who may be suffering from what I can only really describe as <em>coding addiction<\/em>, the solution may be to find healthier rewards. Personally, I am sure that I fall into a trap of addictive computer programming binges at times. What I find most helpful is to focus on the end result: client satisfaction and high quality user experience. Also, having a good mechanism to track progress on projects can help a team realize when they have veered off track and what they can do to get back on track. Generally speaking, any activity that helps a person build personal will and discipline will help them overcome their habits and urges and get back on a more healthy and integrated track: team work, keeping their word and getting things done.<\/p>\n<\/div><button contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"cke-particle-type btn image\" data-id=\"4fdbada4aa8eecee1f000017\"><\/button>","categories":["4f492d65aa8eecec3e00001c"],"code_name":"the_effects_of_computer_programming_on_the_brain","comments":"t","description":"A serious exploration into the motivations and weaknesses of the addicted-to-programming programmer.","display_date":{"sec":1325998800,"usec":0},"featured":"f","image":{"name":"nerd_cat.jpg","size":"53228","type":"image\/jpeg","url":"http:\/\/virtuecenter.s3.amazonaws.com\/files\/2012-01-08-13\/nerd_cat.jpg","height":"314","width":"314"},"status":"published","tags":["programming","incentives","project management"],"title":"The Effects of Computer Programming on the Brain","display_date__formatted":"Jan 08, 2012","separation_path":"\/blogs\/the_effects_of_computer_programming_on_the_brain.html"}],"pagination":{"limit":"10","skip":"0","total":34}}
